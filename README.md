# GoogleChatbot
To help you to configured your Google DialogFlow chatbot, we have added most of our code in here.

You have two different directories where the python_test and node_js_script.

## Python Test
The python_test directory is only a test directory and will never been used for your actual chatbot.
Read the README.md file for more information how to use that test script.

## Node JS Script
Here is all the code to communicate with your chatbot, and this code will be used when you pushing the Node JS code to Google Cloud Functions.
